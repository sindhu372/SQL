# SQL (Structured Query Language)
1. is a programming language used to communicate with databases.
2. is used to access and manipulate the data in a database.
3. SQL is an ANSI (American national standard institute)
4. SQL is not case-sensitive

# Database
1. is a collection of organized data that may be structured, unstrutured and semi-structured , stored on computer systems.
2. It can be managed by #DBMS (database management system), a software to manage the data.
3. The primary goal of a database is to store a huge amount of data.
4. Data present in the database can be easily accessed, updated, deleted using SQL (structured query language)
5. There are different types of databases to handle different data and use-cases. 
6. Relational Database and Non- relational Database

# DBMS:  
1. is a software that manages a database by storing, retrieving, and manipulating the data from database. # Ex: oracle, MySQL...Etc. are some DBMS tools.

# Databases Challenges
1. Scalability : as data increases data storage and processing demands increases
2. Performance Optimization:
3. Data Security:
4. Data Consistency and Integrity:
5. Data Quality:
6. Backup and Disaster Recovery:
7. Data Governance and Compliance:

# Datawarehouse (think first , load later)
1. is a system that gathers raw data from different source into a single, central, consistent data store to perform data analysis.
2. A data warehouse system enables an organization to run powerful analytics on huge volumes (petabytes) of historical data in ways that a standard database cannot.
3. Data warehouse maintain both current + historic data.
4. Traditionally, data warehouse was hosted on-premises. Now-a-days DW is hosted on cloud too.
5. DW is structured using predefined schema.
6. #note : databases is used for transactional processing and datawareHouse is used for analytical processing.
7. Data warehouses often use a #dimensional model, organizing data into fact tables (containing business facts or metrics) and dimension tables (containing descriptive attributes)

# on-premises
1. refers to computing infrastructure and software that are located within the physical premises of an organization.
2. which means organization/business maintain there own servers/data centers and managed by internal IT staff.

# Advantages of DW:
1. Better data quality:
2. Faster, business insights:
3. Smarter decision-making:

# DDL ( data defination language)
1. DDL commands are used to define, modify and manage the structure of database objects like table, view, constraints and indexes.
2. Create :
